Usually it is about rebuilding or renovating older properties where you want to maintain the original impression, but of course you can create these floors to fit into more modern premises. | Applications: About Art Excellence The richness of detail and craftsmanship is in a class of its own. The choice of wood type and design is virtually unlimited. The production means that parquet blanks are specially manufactured and assembled in different ways in modules, in optional patterns. We do not stock a standard product of Art Excellence, but everything is manufactured according to the customer s wishes. We also manufacture other special floors in the Excellence series. This can be French Fishbones or strip bands with detailed inertialists of precious woods or modern aluminum strips. Only the imagination sets limits. In addition to the product itself, the customer of course chooses optional types of wood and surface treatments. We collaborate with experts in both raw materials and surface treatments of all kinds. We also have good contacts with especially talented craftsmen for laying these exclusive floors, which we always recommend for a nice result.

Many times it can be difficult to deal with these problems. There are plastics and linoleum floors on the market with an acoustic backing that provide step noise reduction, but many times its properties are not sufficient to meet the set requirements. A known phenomenon is also the good drum sound properties of the glued parquet floors, in comparison with floating constructions. At the same time, however, a very poor step sound improvement is created when the parquet is anchored to the subfloor. With Decibel 1, you will find the market s most efficient acoustic solutions for step and drum sound for 2.5 mm linoleum and glued Art Mosaic parquet.

In 2012, we launched the next generation acoustic mat, Decibel 4. Although it is only 2 mm thicker than Decibel 3, it offers a marked acoustic improvement in comparison. This comes in handy when the basic conditions are tough, for example old attic floors, light constructions or thin concrete floors. With Decibel 4, we have taken a big step forward. Thanks to a new formula for the composition and cell structure of the rubber, greater efficiency is created in the product s ability to absorb energy. We have also developed a new top in polyester which we call dB backing . This is significantly more durable, which makes it more durable for tough handling on construction sites. dB backing is important in the Soundseal design. On the one hand, it must hold tight to the process water in the leveling compound so that it does not flow through the carpet, but at the same time it must not be diffusion-tight. dB-backing takes these properties to a new level to improve the result for both the customer and the contractor who will work with the product.

Decibel Compact is specially developed to be able to be combined directly with tiles. | Applications: Acoustic solution for tiles We are now pleased to present the Decibel Compact. Here we have developed a carpet with only 2 mm construction height and a very solid character to cope with the loads for the plate and the joint. The function was given priority and then the limit value for the acoustics was given its rightful place. The Decibel Compact carpet is glued to the surface with ordinary floor wall glue. Then the tile is mounted with a standard adhesive class C2TE. Joining is done with a standard tile joint. This construction builds a total of only 15 mm including a 10 mm tile, which makes perfect height adjustment to eg floating laminated parquet, which is very common in apartments. The step noise reduction is ca 10 dB. Tests are underway with fixes and joints that have more plastic properties as the step noise reduction is further improved. In combination with Herrljunga Terrazzo: Decibel 2 can also be directly combined with Herrljunga Terrazzo and then offers extremely improved step sound level and sound absorption.

Also for glued Art Mosaic and Industrial Parquet For many years, we have offered effective step noise reduction for our Art Mosaic parquet. This type of parquet is always glued down to the surface, which gives good drum sound in the room, but unfortunately the step noise reduction is very poor. We have already solved this with our dB1 mat with very good results. However, we have strived to improve the load resistance for impressions and expand the combination with our industrial parquet. And to do this while maintaining step noise reduction. With the new Decibel Compact in the construction below, the step noise reduction of ca 16 dB remains, but with higher load resistance and increased product combinations.

A lot has happened since the beginning and not least the development of new floor constructions in combination with stricter acoustics and environmental requirements. We created the basis for the Decibel Concept back in 1988 with a focus on solving acoustic problems in floors and joist constructions. A lot has happened since the beginning and not least the development of new floor constructions in combination with stricter acoustics and environmental requirements. In combination with CLT Decibel Concept has been able to offer effective acoustic solutions regardless of whether it was concrete or wooden beams, but we are constantly looking for new challenges and here we address our latest development in light wooden beams with a focus on CLT (cross laminated timber) also called KL-Trä, KLT , X-Lam, BSP etc. We have also participated in new innovative constructions such as MiTek s Posi Flooring System which you will find on pages 17-19 of the brochure under related files . Interest in building in wood has increased significantly in recent years and a contributing factor is the need to minimize CO2 emissions in construction, which of course are often represented by various concrete structures. However, concrete suffers from a relatively large CO2 impact and the need to find alternative solutions has therefore increased. This trend does not only apply in the Scandinavian countries, but the need has a large international spread. The most widespread construction is the CLT joist, which can be briefly explained as a wood-based construction product that is made up of an uneven number of layers consisting of planed wood. Normally three, five, seven or nine layers are used. Each layer consists of finger-jointed lamellas laid side by side. In each layer, the boards are laid at right angles relative to adjacent layers. Environmentally, wooden floors are completely superior to concrete, but acoustically speaking, it is often a challenge to find solutions that meet the sound requirements for homes, offices, schools and hotels. We have followed developments around CLT and how they tried to meet the sound requirements. Of course, it is possible to build constructions that meet the requirements, but it is also important that this is done cost-effectively, both in terms of time and material costs. But other factors must also be taken into account, such as building heights. This is often forgotten, but a few centimeters lower building height per floor multiplied by the building area quickly results in large cost savings. We have realized that there is a great need for complete solutions where all components are tested together. As an acoustician, working with databases that include different materials is difficult as there is no given guarantee that the product combination will work. The environmental requirements, which are complicated, also apply. Maybe you find a product combination that theoretically works, but what does the situation look like for the overall construction Within Decibel Concept, there are many collaborations around our various constructions to provide security. This also applies to the environmental situation. We work continuously with environmental issues and requirements so that we always meet the requirements from e.g. BASTA, Byggvarobedomningen, Sunda Hus, Svanen, Green Label Plus, etc. We have therefore looked over this entire problem and looked at what opportunities we have within Decibel Concept. Of course, the choice fell in the first place on our well-proven SoundSeal construction where we integrate the Decibel 4 mat under the leveling compound. Information about the tests: The tests we have done as a basis for this information are carried out in LTH s full-scale lab and according to SS-EN ISO 10140-2 and 3 (2010). In parallel, we have carried out a number of field measurements to ensure our guidance. We have chosen to show current construction solutions that solve different sound classes for homes, offices, schools and hotels, with a focus on B and C requirements according to SS 25267, SS 25268 and BBR. We have had the pleasure of collaborating with Saint-Gobain in the development work and all their various constituent products. The tests were carried out in consultation with people who have in-depth knowledge of light wooden beams.

Our recommended constructions in this brochure should be seen as a guide, but it is important that you then take into account all other facts that may affect the acoustic result. For more information, read our brochure on the Decibel Concept with light wooden beams. RELATERADE FILER LCA Decibel Concept In combination with CLT Decibel Concept has been able to offer effective acoustic solutions regardless of whether it was concrete or wooden beams, but we are constantly looking for new challenges and here we address our latest development in light wooden beams with a focus on CLT (cross laminated timber) also called KL-Trä, KLT , X-Lam, BSP etc. We have also participated in new innovative constructions such as MiTek s Posi Flooring System which you will find on pages 17-19 of the brochure under related files . Interest in building in wood has increased significantly in recent years and a contributing factor is the need to minimize CO2 emissions in construction, which of course are often represented by various concrete structures. However, concrete suffers from a relatively large CO2 impact and the need to find alternative solutions has therefore increased. This trend does not only apply in the Scandinavian countries, but the need has a large international spread. The most widespread construction is the CLT joist, which can be briefly explained as a wood-based construction product that is made up of an uneven number of layers consisting of planed wood. Normally three, five, seven or nine layers are used. Each layer consists of finger-jointed lamellas laid side by side. In each layer, the boards are laid at right angles relative to adjacent layers. Environmentally, wooden floors are completely superior to concrete, but acoustically speaking, it is often a challenge to find solutions that meet the sound requirements for homes, offices, schools and hotels. We have followed developments around CLT and how they tried to meet the sound requirements. Of course, it is possible to build constructions that meet the requirements, but it is also important that this is done cost-effectively, both in terms of time and material costs. But other factors must also be taken into account, such as building heights. This is often forgotten, but a few centimeters lower building height per floor multiplied by the building area quickly results in large cost savings. We have realized that there is a great need for complete solutions where all components are tested together. As an acoustician, working with databases that include different materials is difficult as there is no given guarantee that the product combination will work. The environmental requirements, which are complicated, also apply. Maybe you find a product combination that theoretically works, but what does the situation look like for the overall construction Within Decibel Concept, there are many collaborations around our various constructions to provide security.

However, there are situations where the dB2 mat is simply too good in relation to the sound requirements. We consider alternatives with ordinary foam to be excluded, due to its extremely short service life and the drum sound problem this type of substrate creates. Therefore, we have developed a simpler version of the dB2 mat that we call Decibel Wood. Decibel Wood offers an equivalent rubber structure like dB2 fixed with a lower construction height and somewhat limited acoustically, but then only in comparison with our dB2. However, we offer a step noise reduction of an honest 18 dB in combination with a guaranteed lifetime function. We thus offer the same guarantee as for dB2, ie 15 years under parquet with retained acoustic properties. We have also provided Decibel Wood with a moisture barrier so you avoid the plastic foil. We of course offer the joint tape in the same material. Drum sound is important Ordinary foam under parquet creates more drum noise in the room than without a backing, which is accepted information today, but ironically something we tested over 25 years ago. Just like for the dB2 mat, Decibel Wood offers an improvement in drum sound. In the table below, we show the difference between different base materials, the result speaks for itself. Decibel Wood is not as good as dB2 but a fantastic alternative when the sound requirements are slightly lower and it certainly does not matter that the price is lower as well.

Firstly, the acoustic construction will be permanent even if you change floor materials in the future. The choice of floor material does not matter much either. Tile / stone or glued wooden floors, for example, are usually problematic with regard to footsteps. A rental property can otherwise easily get into trouble if the tenants choose to change floor material and thereby change the step noise levels significantly. The SoundSeal design also offers an improvement in airborne sound. By using the SoundSeal construction, you can in some cases choose a thinner concrete construction when designing and still meet set sound requirements. Thinner construction means lower construction heights and usually lower cost. A basic rule is that the worse the floor s acoustic basic condition is, the greater the benefit the Soundseal construction offers. We mainly recommend Decibel 3 or 4 for the SoundSeal construction as these give the best results. In cases where the construction height is a problem, it is possible to add Decibel 1 or 2 and thinner layers of leveling compound. https://aprobo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Soundseal-instructional-film-English.mp4 RELATERADE FILER Product sheet Environmental documents LCA Decibel Concept SoundSeal in combination with KLT flooring Terms dB Floor Heating About SoundSeal You win several arguments by using this method.

We chose to stick to between shades of gray and not to mix colors, for a close connection to the natural wool. Of course, there is no dyeing, but the yarn is dyed before weaving to get an even color image over the carpet. We coat the back with a so-called actionback made of 100 polypropylene. The carpet is manufactured in 4 m width as standard but can also be ordered in 2 m width. Zealand Wool is a natural choice for the office environment or other areas where design and environmental thinking are desired to be combined with durability.
